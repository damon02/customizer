# customizer

This project started out as a fan project to easily make and customize my own shoes. 

## How it works

The website uses multi layered imagery placed atop eachother in a certain order, where it will look as if the shoe is actually customizable. In reality you are applying a [CSS filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter) to the images.
